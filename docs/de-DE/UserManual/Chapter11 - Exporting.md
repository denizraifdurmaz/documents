# Exporting Network Data {#chapter_mnk_syf_xp}

## Introduction {#section_wnk_syf_xp}

PSS®ODMS has the following network model export functions:

1.  PSS®E

2.  CIM/XML

Any Network Analysis case can be directly exported to PSS®E format.

The Export CIM/XML function provides the capability to export the
PSS®ODMS network model to CIM/XML format. The CIM/XML produced by
PSS®ODMS is formatted in compliance with the ENTSO-E CGMES and NERC CPSM
profiles (depending on CIM version), supporting regulatory guidelines
and/or mandates for data exchange between utilities or other regulating
authorities.

Note: All model data export commands require a database model to be open
in PSS®ODMS.

## PSS®E Export {#section_g4k_syf_xp}

To export the PSS®ODMS model to PSS®E format, first build a case, then
use the corresponding Export Case command (refer to
[???](#section_xbw_3zf_xp)).

Note: Besides creating a RAW file, the PSS®E Export function can
optionally create a corresponding SEQ (short circuit) file and a GCAP
(generator capability curve data) file, the content of which depend on
the existence of the required data in the PSS®ODMS model. In addition, a
UCTE file can be generated by the RAW-to-UCTE converter which is
supported specifically for PSS®E v31 export.




## CIM/XML Export {#section_h4k_syf_xp}

To export the PSS®ODMS model to CIM/XML format:

1.  Choose the ***Model>Export>CIM/XML Model*** command to launch the
    Export CIM/XML Model dialog.

2.  Select export format. Consolidated (single CIM/XML file) option will
    export the CIM/XML in a single file. Profile-based (multiple CIM/XML
    files) option will export multiple profiles based on CGMES profile.
    In profile-based export, user can select profiles (such as
    Equipment, Topology, SSH etc.) to be export.

3.  Click the browse (\...) button to the right of the CIM/XML File box
    to select the fully-qualified file path.

4.  In the Export CIM/XML Model dialog, verify the remaining selections
    and click OK. A progress dialog will appear while the export
    function is running. When the export function completes, a message
    box will indicate completion. The resulting log file can be found in
    the PSS®ODMS log directory.

Note: To export CIM/XML model from a Modeling Authority Set right click
on the Modeling Authority Set in CIMedit and select Export CIM/XML
command.
